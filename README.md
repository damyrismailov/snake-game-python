# Snake Game

Classic snake game built with Python and the turtle module.

## Main features

- Snake moves with the arrow keys.
- Food appears at random positions.
- Snake grows when it eats food.
- Hitting the wall or the snake’s own body ends the game.
- Scoreboard with current score and high score.

## What I learned

- Animating with the turtle module.
- Building the game from classes (snake, food, scoreboard).
- Keyboard event handling.
- Collision detection and a simple game loop.

## How to run

Open `main.py` in Python 3 and run the file.
